											<h4>Concept art image processor website</h4>
											<p>Over the past summer, a friend reached out and asked me to help him with his passion project. We decided to build an image generator for concept art that anyone could use. I have primarily focused on the front-end development of this website, while he has done most of the back-end development. Click the picture to the left to see the website. The website is still a work in progress, so some features will not work.</p>

											<h4>Helped co-develop a miniature video game</h4>
											<p>This past summer, a friend and I participated in the 2023 GMTK Game Jam. The Game Jam included a two-day competition to develop a miniature video game to fit the theme of "roles reversed". We decided to do a spin of the famous game "Duck Hunt", but in our version you play as the ducks rather than the hunter. To develop this, we used C# and Unity. You can click on the image on the left to view the end result of the two-day effort.</p>

									<p>Here are a few examples of projects that were a part of my school curriculum that I am proud of.</p>

										<article>
											<a href="lowpassfilter.html" class="image"><img src="images/pic04.jpg" alt="Circuit" /></a>
											<div class="inner">
												<h4>Designed a low-pass filter</h4>
												<p>In Circuits 2, I designed a filter to accept or reject input signals.  The filter was designed to reject input frequencies higher than the established set breakpoint frequency and accept those that were lower.  This included ordering the parts needed (resistors, capacitors, op amp), using P-spice to make sure the math checks out, and using Eagle PCB design software to layout the low pass filter on a PCB board. I sent the board layout to be printed off on a PCB board. I finished out the process by soldering all the hardware components in their correct position. You can see the full lab report by clicking on the image to the left.</p>

										<article>
											<a href="ScrollingDisplay.html" class="image"><img src="images/pic05.jpg" alt="BASYS 3" /></a>
											<div class="inner">
												<h4>Programmed a BASYS 3 board to display my name scrolling</h4>
												<p>In Intro into Digital and Logical Design, I programmed a BASYS 3 board using the VHDL language. We used Vivado to program the board. The end result was my name scrolling from left to right when one of the switches were flipped. You can read about the project by clicking on the image to the left.</p>

										<article>
											<a href="https://github.com/Cole-Bartley/Mazewalking-Project" class="image"><img src="images/pic06.jpg" alt="Maze-Walking Github" /></a>
											<div class="inner">
												<h4>Maze walking program in python</h4>
												<p>In Programming 2, we were tasked with a maze walking problem when given a text file input that would show a "maze". The maze was marked with "P" (people), "S"(street), "@"(sewers), and "#"(buildings). The goal was to see how a "blob" (marked "B") would spread through a city, if the blob could only move through streets ("S") and people ("P"). The sewers ("@") allowed the blob ("B") to transport to a different part of the maze. The buildings ("#") were walls that the blob could not pass. You can see this project on GitHub by clicking on the image to the left.</p>
